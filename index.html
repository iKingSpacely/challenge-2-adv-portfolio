            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
            <p>My name is Adam Colin and welcome to my portfolio! I received a Bachelors of Communications from DePaul University, majoring in Public Relations & Advertising while minoring in Marketing. Swiftly started my career in Advertising in the city of Chicago at one of the top 3 media agencies in the world, Publicis. Throughout my media agency career I primarily worked on National Strategy for brands like Oracle and Miller Lite, covering all forms of media and ensuring that there was a cohesive full-year plan that hit all business objectives for each brand.</p>
            <p>In 2018, I began my publisher side journey at Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, as a Client Strategist, essentially doing the same thing I did at the media agency, but for strategies specific to the Twitch service. As I continued to excel at my Client Strategist role, I was promoted into the Sales organization, where I was able to actively present strategies and ensure that they were tailored specifically to each brand.</p>
            <p>After another extremely successful campaign on the Sales side, I decided that it was time for a career change. I wanted to push myself to become better and more knowledgeable about the intricacies of the tech world and how I can begin a career in Full Stack Development!</p>
